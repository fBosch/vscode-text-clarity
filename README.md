# Text Clarity 
> Note: If visual studio code notifies you that it is corrupted, simply click "Don't show again"

This package disabled anti-aliasing of the editor; allowing for the usage of bitmap like fonts (as in the example above: Terminus (TTF))

Since Visual Studio Code doesn't support custom css by default this extension makes some minor changes to an index.html file in the source files of Visual Studio Code.

The extension can be disabled on demand with no problems, but if you wish to uninstall it then please run the following command before doing so:

![uninstall](https://github.com/fBosch/vscode-text-clarity/raw/master/images/uninstall.png)

This removes the modifications previously made.
